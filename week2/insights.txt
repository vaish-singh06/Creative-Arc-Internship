TASK 3: OUTLIERS

Chosen Column: Reviews
Reason: High review counts represent genuinely popular apps.
Action: Capped instead of removing.
Other numeric columns were not modified to preserve business meaning.

TASK 5: EDA INSIGHTS

1. Category Distribution:
Family and Game categories are highly competitive.
This indicates saturation and high entry barriers.

2. Free vs Paid:
Free apps dominate the Play Store.
Revenue is likely driven by ads rather than downloads.

3. Rating vs Reviews:
Higher reviews do not always mean higher ratings.
Popularity and quality are not perfectly correlated.

4. Unexpected Insight:
Paid apps have slightly higher average ratings.
Users may expect better quality from paid apps.

TASK 6: THINKING QUESTIONS

Q1:
Removing apps with missing ratings introduces survivorship bias.
New or niche apps would be unfairly excluded, skewing analysis toward established apps.

Q2:
More data is not always better.
Unclean data can mislead models and decisions.
Clean, well-understood data produces more reliable insights.
